# Stack Overflow Developer Survey Analysis

Objective
Analyze developer survey data and job postings to identify trends in programming languages, databases, platforms, and frameworks, and provide actionable insights for technology hiring and career development.

Actions Performed
1. Data Acquisition: Collected data from APIs, web scraping, and CSV datasets, including Stack Overflow Developer Survey data.
2. Data Wrangling: Cleaned and wrangled data by handling missing values, normalizing columns, and transforming categorical data for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in technology usage, job demand, and regional trends.
4. Data Visualization: Created visualizations using Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) and interactive dashboards in IBM Cognos Analytics and Google Looker Studio.
5. Analyzed job postings for multiple locations and technologies, storing results in Excel for easy reporting.

Key Results
1. Most in-demand technologies: Python, JavaScript, Java, SQL, and PostgreSQL.
2. Geographical insights: San Francisco, Seattle, and New York had the highest concentration of job postings.
3. Technology trends: Cloud computing and AI-related skills are rising, while traditional languages remain relevant.
4. Visualizations effectively highlighted trends, correlations, and outliers in both technology adoption and job market data.

Conclusion
1. This project demonstrates how data analysis can uncover actionable insights in the tech industry. 
2. Python and JavaScript are critical for current demand.
3. SQL and NoSQL databases remain widely used.
4. Emerging skills in cloud and AI present opportunities for future growth.
5. Organizations can leverage these insights for strategic hiring, training, and technology planning.
